<h4><em><b>Preliminary Findings</b></em></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Tags need to be heirarchical or layered i.e. a parent category to roll up respective tags is helpful for dissemination
		<li>Some tags just don't belong eg - proprietary technology
			<ul>
					<li>These should be moved into a separate labels column
			</ul>
		<li>Some tags are too granular to be useful
			<ul>
					<li>We should move these into a labels column
				        <li>These are to be utilized on a UI for filtering purposes
					<li>Judge granularity by examining the number of the companies in the final list that fall in that intersection
					<li>Be cautious with the above process though - not all low # tags should be eliminated because they might indicate a sector that does not have a lot of competition yet, but soon could
			</ul>
			<li>Support a drill down view into the treemap
				<ul>
					<li>This will allow people who are interested in say: Human Launch to explore that area further
				</ul>
</ul>

<h4><em><b>Findings</b></em></h4>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="resources/rev_cooccurence.html">Revenue Co-occurence</a> chart shows that most revenue tags appear to occur on their own
		<ul>
			<li>This is great for segmentation
			<li>The few revenue tags that break this mold (perhaps meaningfully so) are
				<ul>
					<li>Other Satellite Hardware and Satellite Design & Manufacturing
					<li>Light Satellite Launch and Light Satellite Deployment
					<li>Remote Sensing and Earth Observation
				</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>Use the <a href="resources/sector_rev.html">Revenue Treemap</a> to find sector/revenue overlaps that you do/don't like
		<ul>
			<li>For eg - The tag for <em>Satellite Hardware</em> has 11 companies that fall under the sector <b>Infrastructure</b> and 27 that fall under the sector <b>Satellite</b>
			<li>Lots of revenue tags that relate to <em>Satellite</em> are spread out around different sectors
			<li>It's great that sector and subsector are placeholders for now - because this gives us a chance to finetune those buckets and find inconsistencies, if any
		</ul>
